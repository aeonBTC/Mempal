- New app icon.
- Tap to refresh any individual dashboard card.
- Save multiple custom mempool servers in settings.
- New settings option to change notification intervals from minutes to seconds.
- Fee distribution data will now fallback to mempool.space when using a custom mempool server.
	This was done because of a current bug with self hosted mempool servers. See #2 for more info.
- Widget data now defaults to mempool.space when using Tor.
	This was done because widgets will not fetch data properly unless Tor is running 24/7 as a background service.
	All other app functions in dashboard and notifications will still respect custom mempool servers using Tor.
- Major optimizations and various bug fixes.
