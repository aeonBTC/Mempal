### Mempal is a Bitcoin network monitoring app that allows users to effortlessly track key metrics. It's the essential tool for users who want to optimize their Bitcoin usage and save on fees.

Key Features:

- **Detailed Insights:** Mempal provides in-depth information about the current state of the Bitcoin network, including current block height, hashrate, mempool size, fee rates, and fee distribution. This allows users to gauge network congestion and make informed decisions regarding transaction fees.

* **Real-Time Notifications:** Tailored notification settings to receive alerts when transaction fees decrease, when a specific TXID is confirmed, or when new blocks are mined.

* **Fee Estimator:** Calculate transaction fees by selecting address type, number of inputs and outputs, optional multisig configuration, and fee rate preference.

* **Custom Servers:** Connect Mempal to a self-hosted mempool server so you don't have to trust third parties to obtain information about the Bitcoin network.

* **Tor Integration:** Built-in Tor integration to preserve your privacy when tracking TXIDs. 

* **Widgets:** Receive quick and up-to-date information about key network metrics.
